👋 Hi! I'm Mohamed Shighash A S, an aspiring data scientist passionate about transforming 🔄 raw data into actionable insights. Currently, I'm expanding my skills in Python 🐍 and Power BI, and I'm eager to apply these tools in a dynamic work environment through an internship. Let me tell you a bit more!

During my academic journey, I've tackled numerous projects that dealt with large datasets 📊, which not only honed my analytical skills but also fueled my interest in data science. My strength lies in my persistence to understand the story behind the data and my ability to present these stories in clear, impactful ways.

I thrive on challenges and am always on the lookout for opportunities to learn more and better myself. As someone who is genuinely excited by the potential of data, I am seeking opportunities where I can contribute, grow, and make a significant impact.

Let's connect! 🌐 I would love to discuss how I can bring value to your team with my passion for data and analytics.
